# Exploring Opportunities for a New Restaurant Using Yelp GraphQL API

## Project Overview

As part of my **Enterprise Database Management** course, I explored the opportunity of setting up a new restaurant in Chicago using the **Yelp GraphQL API**. The aim of this analysis was to identify potential trends, gaps, and opportunities in the restaurant market by analyzing data on restaurant reviews, locations, cuisines, and customer preferences.

The data collected from the Yelp GraphQL API provided insights into existing restaurant offerings, customer ratings, and the overall market landscape, which helped in identifying a viable restaurant concept for the city.

## Key Insights

Based on the analysis of the Yelp GraphQL API data, the following insights were identified:

- **Diverse Range of Cuisines**: Chicago shows a broad diversity of cuisines, suggesting that fusion concepts could be a viable option to stand out.
- **Location Decision**: When considering a new restaurant, location choice should be based on the concentration of similar restaurants in the area.
- **Saturated Pizza Market**: A high concentration of pizza restaurants indicates that this segment is highly competitive and potentially oversaturated.
- **Less Competitive Areas**: Areas with fewer competing restaurants but high foot traffic could be ideal locations for a new venture.
- **Active Food Culture**: Areas with frequent food events show that there is an active and engaged food culture, which could translate to potential customer interest.
- **Web Presence**: Businesses with a strong web presence tend to perform better, indicating the importance of digital marketing and online presence.

## Proposed Restaurant Concept

Based on the analysis, I propose opening a **Korean Fusion Restaurant** in Chicago, offering:

- Traditional **Korean dishes** alongside creative fusion options that blend Korean flavors with other global cuisines.
- **Unique dessert offerings** inspired by traditional Korean desserts like Bingsu, Tteok, and other sweets, with a modern twist.
  
This concept aims to fill the gap in Chicagoâ€™s diverse food scene by combining the appeal of popular Korean cuisine with innovative fusion dishes and distinctive desserts.

## Technologies Used

- **Yelp GraphQL API**: Data source for restaurant information, reviews, and customer preferences.
- **Python**: Used for API integration and data analysis.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For data analysis and visualization.
- **GitHub**: Repository for storing and sharing the project code and results.

## Conclusion

This project reinforced the importance of contextualizing data within a business framework. Through detailed market analysis, I was able to recognize the competitive landscape, identify gaps in the market, and develop a tailored restaurant concept that could meet consumer demand. The opportunity to open a Korean fusion restaurant in Chicago seems promising based on the data-driven insights.

## Future Improvements

- **Market Surveys**: Conducting market surveys to further validate the concept and refine the restaurant offerings.
- **Customer Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzing customer reviews more deeply to identify pain points and unmet needs.
- **Competitor Analysis**: Monitoring competitors to stay updated on market shifts and customer preferences.
